               <div class="body"><div class="image"></div> <div id="content" class="content"><p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>December 27, 2008, the case of ‘Melamine milk powder’ that shocked
the whole country pushed food safety problem to public opinion.In the following
years, gutter oil, clenbuterol, industrial gelatin, sodium cyclamate, and
poisonous ginger. These food safety incidents have been exposed one by one.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span></span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In 2012, Kallon left the PR industry which worked more than ten
years, started a business in the field of Finance and agriculture. This year,
he also participated in the knowledge competition of the youth food safety as
an executive secretary. And the match was a great touch to him.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>"I found children know nothing at all about food
safety.Children should establish self-protective functions to themselves at
least. It's like language. We should educate children to care about their
bodies, children should know what to eat is good for their health, what they
eat is bad for their health.”</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Although the knowledge competition of the youth food safety didn't
go on for various reasons, Kallon remained in the food industry. Now he has
been in the food industry for nearly ten years, and he has witnessed and
participated in the efforts of practitioners in food safety.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Iterduo understands that, before that, the first reasonwhy food
safety problem is difficult to control is that no mutual trust mechanism. The
food field involves many aspects. The supply of food raw materials, the
production of food, the supply chain, all kinds of food enterprises, hardware
enterprises involved in the process of food circulation,many pain points are
urgently to be solved.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>As a public, distributed account, block chain is different from
centralization recording mode. The data source is single, and the data record
is consistent (by recording data at all nodes), so a clearer tracking channels
can be created in all links.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Therefore, by using block chain, food companies can trace back to
the source of food problemsmore quickly. This can not only reduce the risk of
consumers, provide security, but also reduce financial losses through a targeted
recall.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>And now, as the first inventor of Ifoods chain, Kallon has
accumulated many block chain related patents and software copyright.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">
    <b><span>Establishing internal trust mechanism in food industry, achieving
global food safety information sharing</span></b> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In December 2013, Central Bank of China issued “<i>ANotice on Preventing the Risk of Bitcoin</i>”, which made Kallonobserve
the block chain technology, whichforeshadowed the open of Ifoods chain.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>During the years of entrepreneurship in the food industry, Kallon
learned that, "for food companies, especially large food companies, they
are the least willing to produce food safety problems. But the bigger the
company is, the harder it is to manage the purchase and logistics. Many food
companies also face counterfeit products.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In fact, as early as 2012, the traceability mechanism of food safety
has been enforced. The main way of tracing is the origin of QR code.
Information about every link of food is input to the system, and users inquire
the source, transportation and other information of food through QR code.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>But QR codes are easily impersonate. The better brand and product
are, the easier it is to be counterfeited. Finally, the food enterprises will
be faced with the problem of being complained by consumers.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>But the problem is not limited to being counterfeited, QR code
traceability first needs consumers to scan the food source proactively, but the
consumer has not yet fully trained to scan the awareness of food, so even if
the enterprise bought the traceability system, its actual utilization rate is
very low.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In the construction of food safety ecosystem, the most important is
that data cannot be tampered. Traditional certificate of proof is not strict in
the past, because these evidences are very easy to be forged and destroyed.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Block chain technology happens to be able to solve this problem.When
food companies attach the label of the Internet of things to the goods, each
batch is assigned a unique identification number, which can record the source
of the product, the processing information, the storage temperature, shelf life
and other information. The whole process of record keeping is transparent.
Without any third party's intervention, it can prove the authenticity of the
information.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>As the food industry is a global circulation industry, a transparent
and reliable unified information platform can be obtained through the block
chain. It can view the state in real time, reduce the cost of logistics, trace
the production and transport of the whole process, so as to improve the
efficiency of supply chain management. When disputes occur, evidence and
tracing are also more clear and easy.</span>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>It is understood that the large and internal processes have been
more scientific and systematic food companies have the motivation to use block
chain to improve the traceability of products. After joining the related block
chain, the probability of being wrongly killed when the above pain point occurs
is reduced.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>At the same time, the block chain platform of the food industry
helps to link the related enterprises and business entities in the food
industry chain, and ultimately helps to improve the quality of the global food
supply chain as a whole, and reduce the related asymmetry of the food industry
chain.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>At every stage of the supply chain, it can be recorded in the block
chain system, so that we can get real-time data of products and their
historical records at any time and anywhere.</span>

    <b><span>Researching and developing super probe, solving the last mile food
safety problems.</span></b> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>"After seeing the announcement of the central bank, I studied
it and found that its underlying block chain technology can help the food
industry do many things." By the end of 2015, Kallon began to build a
team, dedicated to solve the food safety in the last mile.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://lbcydemo.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/20180508134914.png" alt="">
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">
    The schematic diagram of super probes and mobile
terminals (as the core hardware of Ifoods chain, is very small in size and easy
to carry around).
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Kallon tells iterduo, Ifoodschain has three
core functions: 1. improving the detection efficiency, 2. Improving food
productivity, 3. reducing the damage of the food industry.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>All the above traceability behaviors should
be based on solving the last mile to food safety problems. That is to say, only
consumers measure food can produce other functions including traceability,
supervision and big data.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>The development of super probe is based on
the last mile. In Kallon’s view, when the super probe can detect food
problemsaccurately, conveniently and efficiently. In that way, everyone should
have a super probe in their hands, because food safety concerns your whole family
health.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>With beef as an example, the quality of
meat is difficult to see with the naked eye, so when consumers go to the
supermarket to buy beef, they can measure with super probe first, through the
measurement, the results of are fed back to the cell phone finally. It tells
you whether the beef has been injected with water and contains lean meat
essence.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>It is understood that the current beef
detection is the first application of the Ifoods chain block chain ecological
platform.<a name="_GoBack"></a> Among the core developers of the team, 70 years
old American University of Georgia food science, the president of Newleigh
china proper, Dr. Lin Ruji, are also among them.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>It is revealed that the demo of super probe
will be launched in June of this year. It is estimated that in September, the
super probe will complete the test iteration.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;">
    <b><span>Summarize</span></b> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Ifoods chain's team hopes to build an open
source and open type ecological platform of block chain for food and related fields.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In August 2017, 10 of the world's largest
retail and food suppliers were working together with IBM to integrate the block
chain into its supply chain. From then on, food suppliers would be able to
trace the ingredients more quickly.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>The ten companies include WAL-MART, Nestle,
Unilever, Mccormick, Tyson, Krogh, Mcclain, Driscoll, Dole and Jinzhou food,
and their annual global sales combined more than five trillion dollars. This
also seems to prove that block chain has certain positive effects on the field
of food safety.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In order to put the product information on
the block chain platform easily, the Ifoods chain team provides the Usp system
for the business, even if you are the technology green hand, it can also upload
food information to the block chain platform of the Ifoods chain at any time.</span> 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>This will give them the most efficient
access to the global food industry data, and help the food industry develop at
the bottom which Improve productivity and productivity to a certain extent.</span>
