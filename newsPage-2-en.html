    <span>26<sup>th</sup>, March. People’s Daily Online report (reporter Li
Tong), At present, Blockchain has become a fashionable hot word. Business pays
more attention to technology than it does, as if the block chain is
"golden glittering".As a distributed bookkeeping way, how can block
chaining technology change from concept to application? What bottlenecks are
needed to break through now?</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b><span>From “demonize” to
“apotheosis”: How to look at the block chain?</span></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Previously, Bitcoin and ICO's " quick profit" made the
block chain into the public view.To block chain turn pale at the only mention
of something terrible, it is demonized; all kinds of industries talk about the
combination of block chain and think that it is a sharp weapon for turning
corners, deified it and thought it was omnipotent.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <a name="_GoBack"></a><b><span>What is
block chain in the end? Will it become a new outlet?</span></b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>At the "2018 China Development Forum" which was held
recently, the Ant Financial CEO Jin Xiandong said that the core of the block
chain is to create multiparty trust mechanism with technology, solve the
credible problems of data, goods, assets and people, and to promote efficient
collaboration across institutions and individuals.With the acceleration of the
global digitalization process, block chain technology will become the
cornerstone of the trust in digital society, so that participants can more
efficiently excavate the value behind data.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Chinese development forum is sponsored by the development research
center of the State Council, the topics on the forum represents the latest
thinking of the industry a certain extent.China is the largest market in the
application of block chain technology, and the global perspective is exploring
the "Chinese answer".</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Technology itself is not good or bad. The biggest bottleneck of
block chain is whether technology can break throughconstantly, and confusion
lies in the future application direction.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>"There is a proverb in the west, it is that don't throw
children away when you pour bath water.” Jacob Frankel, the president of J.P.Morgan
International, believes that any technology, from birth to application, needs
to be accumulated and excavated, and it is not easy to say that it is good or
bad.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Jing Xiandong thought that we should be vigilant against the fraud which
borrow the name of the block chain, and avoid the technology which produce
greater value became a victim. "At present, the block chain has not yet
found a large-scale commercial application scene, which is like the 90s
Internet bubble, businesses that have web pages call themselves Internet Co,
but they have no real value.With the burst of bubble, block chain technology
will usher in scale application in commercial field.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Where is the application of technology: not only looking up at the
starry sky, but “grounded”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>How to transform a technology into actual productivity and create
social value through business application is the urgent problem to solve in the
current block chain.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>People in the industry show how to innovate common understanding
algorithms, realize large-scale transaction processing capacity, improve
digital encryption and other technologies, not only make information
transparent and credible, but also guarantee personal privacy, and how to break
through the value transfer and data exchange between different block chains.All
of these are the directions that the industry is seeking to break through, and
also the inevitable answer to the progress of block chain technology.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>“The initial exploration of the technology of block chain is to make
the credibility of business more transparent and efficient, and promote the
continuous development of economic and social.” In Jing Xiandong's view, the
related exploration has begun in the field of public welfare, product
traceability, urban rental management and so on.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>In the supply of high quality food, block chain technology has more
innovative practice."Because of the complex channel of product supply and
the high cost of tracing the source, it is a more operational measure of
controlling retail terminal for the enterprises registered with industry and commerce”.
Ifoodschain founder Kallon told reporters that block chain technology not only
allows consumers to participate in deep, create data and store data, but also
help food enterprises to improve the value of high quality products, avoid
"bad money to expel good money", and create an environment for the
development of the food industry.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>Kallon said that, as an example of beef, through the probe testing
equipment with high precision sensor as the core component, the APP terminal is
connected to the mobile phone, and the quality information of the product can
be fed back to the consumer by the way that is closer to the consumer.Comparing
the tested products with the quality beef index, providing reference but
without conclusion.When the third party social organizations use beef quality
data, they will give back information providers through the form of payment,
and improve the incentive mechanism to form a closed loop. “By exploring the
operation process of block chain technology in the food industry, we set up the
‘China standard’ to provide reference for the global food industry.”</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span>We can find a breakthrough by cognitive problems."Safety and
reliability, information protection, transaction performance and incentive
mechanism are the challenges for large-scale business applications of block
chain."Jing Xiandong believes that, for security, the security of the
algorithm, system security, protocol security, and so on are likely to be
attacked, while in the decentralization mode, there is no responsibility for people
or institutions that bear all responsibilities. In information protection,
there is a need to find solutions between sensitive information and business
secrets and multi stakeholder participation.In terms of transaction
performance, block chain needs multiple consensus, while the efficiency of multi-party
consensus transaction is low, and with the increase of node number, efficiency
decline is more obvious.On the incentive mechanism, we should also solve the
problem of benefit coordination and distribution on the block chain.</span>
